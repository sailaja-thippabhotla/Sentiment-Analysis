# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment analysis is the act of analyzing words to determine sentiments and opinions that may be positive or negative in polarity. This is a type of classification where the classes may be binary (positive and negative) or multiple (happy, angry, sad, disgusted,..). Here I’ll implement this data science project in the language R and use the dataset by the ‘janeaustenR’ package. I will use general-purpose lexicons like AFINN, bing, and loughran, perform an inner join, and in the end, we’ll build a word cloud to display the result.
